# GitHub Repository Setup Steps

## ðŸš€ **Manual GitHub Setup Instructions**

Since GitHub CLI is not installed, follow these steps to create the repository and push the code:

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name**: `Vibe-Ecommerce-Org`
3. **Description**: "Educational vulnerable e-commerce applications for security training - Organization repository"
4. **Visibility**: Public
5. **Initialize**: Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

### 2. Add Remote and Push
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Vibe-Ecommerce-Org.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Alternative: Create Organization Repository
If you want to create this under an organization:

1. Go to https://github.com/organizations/new
2. Create organization named: `Vibe-Ecommerce`
3. Then create repository under the organization:
   - Go to https://github.com/Vibe-Ecommerce
   - Click "New repository"
   - Name: `Vibe-Ecommerce-Org`
   - Make it public
   - Don't initialize with files
