### ⚠️ **Important Caveat: "More Secure" vs "More Vulnerable"**
Version 3 actually **implements more security features** than the other versions (bcrypt, MFA, rate limiting), but it's still the **most vulnerable** because all these features are **implemented but completely bypassable**. This creates a **false sense of security** that's more dangerous than having no security features at all. It demonstrates the critical difference between **"having security features"** and **"being secure"**.
